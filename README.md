#The Assingmnet

Read information from a CSV file into pandas, and perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the
two airlines...

NOTE: Professor, Alex Doler and I worked on this assingment together anyone else that has similar code copied
from my REPO (They did not ask permission to use any of this code at all.) We will be presenting it together
on tuesday March 7th. Thanks.
